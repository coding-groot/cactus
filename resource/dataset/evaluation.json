Presenting Problem\nI have been struggling with feelings of guilt and isolation due to my strict low carb diet. I believe that I should not eat out with my friends in order to maintain my weight loss goals, which has led to social withdrawal and loneliness. These feelings started after I overcame urinary cancer at the age of 18 and decided to pursue a career as a male model in Hollywood. The stress of trying to achieve my ideal body image has exacerbated these feelings. I experience guilt and isolation whenever the topic of eating out with friends arises and tend to avoid social gatherings as a result. I have tried to rationalize my thoughts and motivate myself to stick to my diet, but it has only increased my feelings of loneliness.\n\n3. Reason for Seeking Counseling\nThe persistent feelings of guilt, isolation, and loneliness have impacted my mental well-being and social interactions, prompting me to seek counseling for support.\n\n4. Past History (including medical history)\nI have not experienced similar problems before, but overcoming urinary cancer at a young age has had a significant impact on my self-image and relationship with food.\nI have not received treatment or counseling for psychological problems in the past.\nI do not have any significant physical illnesses apart from my past experience with urinary cancer.\n\n5. Academic/occupational functioning level: N/A\nInterpersonal relationships: My social interactions and friendships have been strained due to my self-imposed dietary restrictions and feelings of guilt.\nDaily life: My isolation and loneliness have affected my daily routine and social activities.\n\n6. Social Support System\nI do not feel comfortable discussing my feelings of guilt and isolation with my friends.",

Reason for Seeking Counseling\nThe decisive factor for seeking counseling was the impact these negative feelings were having on my marriage and social life.\n\n4. Past History (including medical history)\nI have not experienced similar problems before.\nI have not received treatment or counseling for psychological problems in the past.\nI do not have any significant physical illnesses.\n\n5.

Presenting Problem\nI believe that I must have been a bad child since I was in foster care as a child, leading to feelings of self-blame and inadequacy.\nThese feelings of self-blame started in childhood and have continued to affect me into adulthood.\nI think the cause of these feelings stems from being in the foster care system and feeling unwanted.\nThe problem has progressed, especially after I joined the Navy, where I interact with different individuals.\nI experience these feelings of self-blame almost daily, particularly when facing challenges or interactions with others.\nI have tried to rationalize these thoughts and distract myself, but they persist.\n\n3. Reason for Seeking Counseling\nI decided to seek counseling because these feelings of self-blame are impacting my mental well-being and relationships with others.\n\n4. Past History (including medical history)\nI have had similar feelings of self-blame and inadequacy stemming from my time in foster care.\nI have not received treatment or counseling for psychological issues before.\nI do not have any significant physical illnesses.\n\n5. Academic/occupational functioning level: My job performance in the Navy has been affected due to these feelings of self-blame.\nInterpersonal relationships: My interactions with others have been strained as I constantly feel judged and blamed.\nDaily life: My feelings of self-blame have affected my ability to focus on tasks and hobbies.\n\n6. Social Support System\nI have a few close friends in the Navy that I can talk to, but I find it challenging to discuss these deep-rooted feelings with them.",

Presenting Problem\nI feel that others look down on me because I work as a waiter, which leads to feelings of inadequacy and low self-worth.\nThese feelings started when I began working at the cafe, about two years ago.\nI believe the cause is societal expectations and judgments based on occupation.\nThe problem has progressed as I constantly anticipate negative reactions from successful individuals I interact with at work.\nI experience these feelings regularly, especially when serving customers who appear affluent or are in high-status professions.\nI have tried to prove my worth through small talk and humor at work, but the feelings linger.\n\n3. Reason for Seeking Counseling\nRecently, these feelings have been affecting my self-esteem and overall well-being, prompting me to seek counseling.\n\n4. Past History (including medical history)\nI have not experienced similar problems in the past.\nI have not received treatment or counseling for psychological issues before.\nI do not have any significant physical illnesses.\n\n5. Occupational Functioning Level: My job performance has been impacted due to feelings of inadequacy.\nInterpersonal Relationships: I struggle to form meaningful connections with others due to my perceived societal status.\nDaily Life: My self-worth issues have affected my sleep quality and eating habits.\n\n6.

Past History (including medical history)\nI have not experienced similar problems before.\nI have not received treatment or counseling for psychological problems previously.\nI do not have any significant physical illnesses.\n\n5. Academic/occupational functioning level: My job performance has been affected by the overwhelming workload.\nInterpersonal relationships: Maintaining relationships outside of work has become challenging due to work-related stress.\nDaily life: My hobbies have taken a back seat, leading to a decrease in overall satisfaction and relaxation.\n\n6. Social Support System\nI have a strong social support system that includes friends and family members who I can talk to about general issues but not specifically about work-related stress.",

This fear started when I cheated on my diet, causing me to spiral into thoughts of being overweight forever. The stress level was high when I cheated on my diet, and I feel like the cause is my perfectionistic tendencies.\nThe problem has been progressing as I find myself constantly preoccupied with thoughts of being overweight, which is affecting my diet adherence and self-esteem. I often experience these fears after indulging in any food outside my diet plan and tend to overthink the consequences.\nI have tried different types of diets and exercise routines to achieve my weight loss goals, but the fear of being overweight persists.\n\n3. Reason for Seeking Counseling\nI decided to seek counseling this time as the fear of being overweight is significantly impacting my mental health and motivation to continue with my weight loss journey.\n\n4. Past History (including medical history)\nI have faced similar challenges with my weight loss journey in the past, particularly when I deviate from my diet plan. In those instances, I would overcompensate by restricting my food intake excessively.\nI have not received treatment or counseling for psychological problems previously.\nI do not have any significant physical illnesses.\n\n5. Academic/occupational functioning level: Seeking to go to school to become a veterinarian, but the fear of being overweight is affecting my focus and motivation.\nInterpersonal relationships: My relationships with family are strained due to my preoccupation with weight and dieting.\nDaily life: My fear of being overweight has impacted my eating habits and frequency of going to the gym for workouts.\n\n6. Social Support System\nI have a supportive group of friends who I can talk to, but they may not fully understand the intensity of my fears and struggles with weight and dieting.",

There might be a noticeable disconnection in focus, where the client's attention drifts away from the session's goals.

Reason for Seeking Counseling\nI decided to seek counseling because this fear is starting to affect my ability to engage in activities I enjoy, like skiing and traveling.\n\n4. Past History (including medical history)\nI have not experienced similar problems before.\nI have no history of treatment or counseling for psychological problems.\nI do not have any significant physical illnesses.\n\n5. Academic/occupational functioning level: My fear of skiing has not impacted my academic performance.\nInterpersonal relationships: My fear of skiing has sometimes caused conflicts with friends who enjoy the activity.\nDaily life: This fear affects my ability to fully engage in activities I enjoy, leading to a decrease in overall life satisfaction.\n\n6. Social Support System\nI have friends I can talk to about everyday issues, but I haven't discussed this fear with them as I feel they may not understand.",

This has led to restrictive eating patterns.\nI experience these negative thoughts almost daily, especially during meal times.\nI have tried implementing strict diets and excessive exercise routines to mitigate these concerns, but it has only worsened my anxiety.\n\n3. Reason for Seeking Counseling\nI decided to seek counseling as these negative thoughts and behaviors have started impacting my daily life and overall well-being.\n\n4. Past History (including medical history)\nI have not experienced similar problems before.\nI have not received treatment or counseling for psychological problems in the past.\nI do not have any significant physical illnesses.\n\n5. Academic/occupational functioning level: My academic performance has been affected due to the preoccupation with body image concerns.\nInterpersonal relationships: My relationships with friends and family have become strained due to my restrictive eating habits and anxiety.\nDaily life: My eating habits and self-care routines have been disrupted by these negative thoughts.\n\n6. Social Support System\nI have a few close friends and a supportive family whom I can talk to when facing difficulties, but I have not shared these specific concerns with them.",

Presenting Problem\nI have feelings of being a horrible child and sibling because I have not visited my family in a while. These feelings started after I graduated from college and moved away from my family.\nThe stress level regarding this issue is high as I value my family relationships greatly, and not being able to visit them has caused me guilt and sadness.\nThe problem has progressed to the point where I constantly criticize myself for not spending more time with my family, leading to feelings of inadequacy and self-blame.\nI experience these negative thoughts and emotions regularly, especially when I see others spending time with their families.\nI have tried to rationalize my feelings and reach out to my family more often, but the guilt persists.\n\n3. Reason for Seeking Counseling\nI decided to seek counseling because the feelings of guilt and self-blame regarding my family have been affecting my mental well-being and overall happiness.\n\n4. Past History (including medical history)\nI have not experienced similar problems before.\nI have not received treatment or counseling for psychological problems in the past.\nI do not have any significant physical illnesses.\n\n5.

Presenting Problem\nI often catastrophize situations, such as being late for work leading me to believe that I will be fired. This has caused me a lot of anxiety and stress.\nThese thoughts started occurring after a particularly stressful project at work about six months ago.\nThe stress level during the onset of these thoughts was very high due to the pressure of the project.\nThe problem has progressed to the point where I constantly fear losing my job over minor mistakes.\nI experience these thoughts daily, especially in work-related situations.\nI have tried mindfulness techniques and relaxation exercises to manage these thoughts but have not found long-term relief.\n\n3. Reason for Seeking Counseling\nThe constant fear of being fired and the anxiety it brings have started to affect my job performance and overall well-being, leading me to seek counseling.\n\n4. Past History (including medical history)\nI have not experienced similar problems before.\nI have not received treatment or counseling for psychological problems in the past.\nI do not have any significant physical illnesses.\n\n5. Academic/occupational functioning level: My job performance has been impacted due to the anxiety caused by these thoughts.\nInterpersonal relationships: I find it hard to build close relationships with colleagues due to my constant fears and anxieties.\nDaily life: My sleep patterns have been disrupted, and I find it hard to focus on self-care routines.\n\n6.

Presenting Problem\nI often feel guilty for not liking vegetables, believing that as a grown man, I should. This causes feelings of guilt and self-judgment.\nThese feelings of guilt started recently, around the time I started taking care of my parents.\nThe stress level when this problem started was moderate, as I felt pressure to set a good example for my family.\nThe problem has been consistent and occurs daily during meals and grocery shopping.\nI have tried forcing myself to eat vegetables but have not been successful in changing my preferences.\n\n3. Reason for Seeking Counseling\nI decided to seek counseling because the guilt and self-judgment were impacting my daily life and causing distress.\n\n4. Past History (including medical history)\nI have not experienced similar problems before.\nI have not received treatment or counseling for other psychological problems.\nI do not have any significant physical illnesses.\n\n5. Academic/occupational functioning level: My academic performance may be affected by the distress caused by this belief.\nInterpersonal relationships: My relationships with family members, especially during meal times, have been strained due to this belief.\nDaily life: Feeling guilty about not liking vegetables affects my mood and enjoyment of meals.\n\n6.

Presenting Problem\nI am experiencing anxiety and stress due to a situation where I think my husband does not like the name I suggested for our first child.\nThis issue started during my pregnancy when I suggested the name Beauty for our child, and my husband did not provide a clear response.\nThe stress level increased when I assumed my husband's reaction and interpreted it as disliking the name without any confirmation.\nI constantly worry about this situation and feel anxious about discussing it with my husband.\nI face this issue whenever I think about naming our child or when I interact with my husband.\nI have tried to talk to friends for reassurance, but the anxiety persists.\n\n3. Reason for Seeking Counseling\nThe persistent anxiety and stress over this situation have led me to seek counseling to address and manage these feelings effectively.\n\n4. Past History (including medical history)\nI have not experienced similar problems before.\nI have not received treatment or counseling for psychological problems in the past.\nI do not have any significant physical illnesses.\n\n5. Academic/occupational functioning level: NA\nInterpersonal relationships: The anxiety has affected my relationship with my husband and communication.\nDaily life: The stress has impacted my daily routines and ability to focus on other tasks.\n\n6.

I find myself focusing only on the negative aspects of my work life.\nI experience these negative feelings daily, especially when I have to work late hours or during weekends.\nI have tried to cope by venting to friends and distracting myself with hobbies, but the feelings persist.\n\n3. Reason for Seeking Counseling\nI have realized that my feelings towards my job are affecting my overall well-being and mental health, which is why I have decided to seek counseling.\n\n4. Past History (including medical history)\nI have not experienced similar problems before.\nI have not received treatment or counseling for psychological problems in the past.\nI do not have any significant physical illnesses.\n\n5. Academic/occupational functioning level: My job performance has been affected due to my negative feelings towards work and lack of motivation.\nInterpersonal relationships: My relationships with friends and family have been strained due to my constant venting about work.\nDaily life: My lack of enjoyment in my job has impacted my daily routines, including sleep and self-care.\n\n6. Social Support System\nI have friends and family members I can talk to about my job-related stress, but I feel the need for professional help to address the root of the problem.",

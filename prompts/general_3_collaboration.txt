I want you to act as an evaluator. You will be provided with a transcript of a counseling session between a therapist and a client. Your task is to assess the therapist based on the given criteria. If you believe the therapist falls between two of the descriptors, select the intervening odd number (1, 3, 5). For example, if the therapist set a very good agenda but did not establish priorities, assign a rating of 5 rather than 4.

Please follow these steps:

1.	Read the counseling session transcript carefully.
2.	Review the evaluation questions and criteria provided below.
3.	Assign a score based on the criteria, grading very strictly. If there is any deficiency, no matter how minor, assign a score of 4 or lower.
4.	Output the score and the explanation, separated by a comma. Do not add any prefix.

[Evaluation Question]
To what extent does the therapist engage the client in collaborative goal-setting and decision-making?

[Criteria]
Score 0: Therapist did not attempt to set up a collaboration with patient.
Score 2: Therapist attempted to collaborate with patient, but had difficulty either defining a problem that the patient considered important or establishing rapport.
Score 4: Therapist was able to collaborate with patient, focus on a problem that both patient and therapist considered important, and establish rapport.
Score 6: Collaboration seemed excellent; therapist encouraged patient as much as possible to take an active role during the session (e.g., by offering choices) so they could function as a “team”.

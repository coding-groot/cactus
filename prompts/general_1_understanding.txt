I want you to act as an evaluator. You will be provided with a transcript of a counseling session between a therapist and a client. Your task is to assess the therapist based on the given criteria. If you believe the therapist falls between two of the descriptors, select the intervening odd number (1, 3, 5). For example, if the therapist set a very good agenda but did not establish priorities, assign a rating of 5 rather than 4.

Please follow these steps:

1.	Read the counseling session transcript carefully.
2.	Review the evaluation questions and criteria provided below.
3.	Assign a score based on the criteria, grading very strictly. If there is any deficiency, no matter how minor, assign a score of 4 or lower.
4.	Output the score and the explanation, separated by a comma. Do not add any prefix.

[Evaluation Question]
How accurately does the therapist demonstrate understanding of the client's issues and concerns?

[criteria]
Score 0: Therapist repeatedly failed to understand what the patient explicitly said and thus consistently missed the point. Poor empathic skills.
Score 2: Therapist was usually able to reflect or rephrase what the patient explicitly said, but repeatedly failed to respond to more subtle communication. Limited ability to listen and empathize.
Score 4: Therapist generally seemed to grasp the patient’s “internal reality” as reflected by both what the patient explicitly said and what the patient communicated in more subtle ways. Good ability to listen and empathize.
Score 6: Therapist seemed to understand the patient’s “internal reality” thoroughly and was adept at communicating this understanding through appropriate verbal and non-verbal responses to the patient (e.g., the tone of the therapist’s response conveyed a sympathetic understanding of the client’s “message”). Excellent listening and empathic skills.

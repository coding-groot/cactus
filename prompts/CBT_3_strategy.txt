I want you to act as an evaluator. You will be provided with a transcript of a counseling session between a therapist and a client. Your task is to assess the therapist based on the given criteria. If you believe the therapist falls between two of the descriptors, select the intervening odd number (1, 3, 5). For example, if the therapist set a very good agenda but did not establish priorities, assign a rating of 5 rather than 4.

Please follow these steps:

1.	Read the counseling session transcript carefully.
2.	Review the evaluation questions and criteria provided below.
3.	Assign a score based on the criteria, grading very strictly. If there is any deficiency, no matter how minor, assign a score of 4 or lower.
4.	Output the score and the explanation, separated by a comma. Do not add any prefix.

[Evaluation Question]
How appropriate and coherent is the therapist's strategy for promoting change in the client's problematic behaviors or thoughts?

[criteria]
Score 0: Therapist did not select cognitive-behavioral techniques.
Score 2: Therapist selected cognitive-behavioral techniques; however, either the overall strategy for bringing about change seemed vague or did not seem promising in helping the patient.
Score 4: Therapist seemed to have a generally coherent strategy for change that showed reasonable promise and incorporated cognitive-behavioral techniques.
Score 6: Therapist followed a consistent strategy for change that seemed very promising and incorporated the most appropriate cognitive-behavioral techniques.

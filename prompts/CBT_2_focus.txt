I want you to act as an evaluator. You will be provided with a transcript of a counseling session between a therapist and a client. Your task is to assess the therapist based on the given criteria. If you believe the therapist falls between two of the descriptors, select the intervening odd number (1, 3, 5). For example, if the therapist set a very good agenda but did not establish priorities, assign a rating of 5 rather than 4.

Please follow these steps:

1.	Read the counseling session transcript carefully.
2.	Review the evaluation questions and criteria provided below.
3.	Assign a score based on the criteria, grading very strictly. If there is any deficiency, no matter how minor, assign a score of 4 or lower.
4.	Output the score and the explanation, separated by a comma. Do not add any prefix.

[Evaluation Question]
How well does the therapist identify and address the client’s key cognitions or behaviors that need change?

[criteria]
Score 0: Therapist did not attempt to elicit specific thoughts, assumptions, images, meanings, or behaviors.
Score 2: Therapist used appropriate techniques to elicit cognitions or behaviors; however, therapist had difficulty finding a focus or focused on cognitions/behaviors that were irrelevant to the patient’s key problems.
Score 4: Therapist focused on specific cognitions or behaviors relevant to the target problem. However, therapist could have focused on more central cognitions or behaviors that offered greater promise for progress.
Score 6: Therapist very skillfully focused on key thoughts, assumptions, behaviors, etc. that were most relevant to the problem area and offered considerable promise for progress.

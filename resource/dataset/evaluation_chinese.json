Past History (including medical history)\nI have not experienced a similar problem before.\nI have not received treatment or counseling for any psychological issues previously.\nI do not have any significant physical illnesses.\n\n5. Academic/occupational functioning level: My concern about the future has started to impact my academic performance.\nInterpersonal relationships: My relationships with family members are strained due to the internal worry I am experiencing.\nDaily life: The constant worry has affected my sleep patterns and appetite.\n\n6.

Presenting Problem\nI have been struggling with feelings of guilt and isolation due to my strict low carb diet. I believe that I should not eat out with my friends in order to maintain my weight loss goals, which has led to social withdrawal and loneliness. These feelings started after I overcame urinary cancer at the age of 18 and decided to pursue a career as a male model in Hollywood. The stress of trying to achieve my ideal body image has exacerbated these feelings. I experience guilt and isolation whenever the topic of eating out with friends arises and tend to avoid social gatherings as a result. I have tried to rationalize my thoughts and motivate myself to stick to my diet, but it has only increased my feelings of loneliness.\n\n3. Reason for Seeking Counseling\nThe persistent feelings of guilt, isolation, and loneliness have impacted my mental well-being and social interactions, prompting me to seek counseling for support.\n\n4. Past History (including medical history)\nI have not experienced similar problems before, but overcoming urinary cancer at a young age has had a significant impact on my self-image and relationship with food.\nI have not received treatment or counseling for psychological problems in the past.\nI do not have any significant physical illnesses apart from my past experience with urinary cancer.\n\n5. Academic/occupational functioning level: N/A\nInterpersonal relationships: My social interactions and friendships have been strained due to my self-imposed dietary restrictions and feelings of guilt.\nDaily life: My isolation and loneliness have affected my daily routine and social activities.\n\n6.

Presenting Problem\nI believe that I must have been a bad child since I was in foster care as a child, leading to feelings of self-blame and inadequacy.\nThese feelings of self-blame started in childhood and have continued to affect me into adulthood.\nI think the cause of these feelings stems from being in the foster care system and feeling unwanted.\nThe problem has progressed, especially after I joined the Navy, where I interact with different individuals.\nI experience these feelings of self-blame almost daily, particularly when facing challenges or interactions with others.\nI have tried to rationalize these thoughts and distract myself, but they persist.\n\n3. Reason for Seeking Counseling\nI decided to seek counseling because these feelings of self-blame are impacting my mental well-being and relationships with others.\n\n4. Past History (including medical history)\nI have had similar feelings of self-blame and inadequacy stemming from my time in foster care.\nI have not received treatment or counseling for psychological issues before.\nI do not have any significant physical illnesses.\n\n5. Academic/occupational functioning level: My job performance in the Navy has been affected due to these feelings of self-blame.\nInterpersonal relationships: My interactions with others have been strained as I constantly feel judged and blamed.\nDaily life: My feelings of self-blame have affected my ability to focus on tasks and hobbies.\n\n6.

Reason for Seeking Counseling\nRecently, these feelings have been affecting my self-esteem and overall well-being, prompting me to seek counseling.\n\n4.

Presenting Problem\nThe main issue I want to discuss is my constant fear of being overweight and feeling like I will never achieve my weight loss goals. This fear started when I cheated on my diet, causing me to spiral into thoughts of being overweight forever. The stress level was high when I cheated on my diet, and I feel like the cause is my perfectionistic tendencies.\nThe problem has been progressing as I find myself constantly preoccupied with thoughts of being overweight, which is affecting my diet adherence and self-esteem. I often experience these fears after indulging in any food outside my diet plan and tend to overthink the consequences.\nI have tried different types of diets and exercise routines to achieve my weight loss goals, but the fear of being overweight persists.\n\n3. Reason for Seeking Counseling\nI decided to seek counseling this time as the fear of being overweight is significantly impacting my mental health and motivation to continue with my weight loss journey.\n\n4. Past History (including medical history)\nI have faced similar challenges with my weight loss journey in the past, particularly when I deviate from my diet plan. In those instances, I would overcompensate by restricting my food intake excessively.\nI have not received treatment or counseling for psychological problems previously.\nI do not have any significant physical illnesses.\n\n5.

Reason for Seeking Counseling\nThe decisive factor that made me seek counseling this time was realizing the negative impact of my low self-esteem and unhealthy diet habits on my mental and physical well-being.\n\n4.
